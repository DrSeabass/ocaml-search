Still missing ways of generating latex tables in a nice generic way

Colorization operators are not being passed through to the plotting
code in any way currently. Need to fix that... optional arguments or
maybe a global flag my scripts can read?

Need to have a nice way of pushing candidate group by keys through, so
I don't have to do that silly hack in beam_greedy alg analysis

Confidence intervals are crazy loose on that data in the new system,
but they weren't before.  What is up?

scooby doo, where are you?
