Make a meta-experiment executor which will run a single alg on all domains

clean up and comment code

additional domains

dynamic robots won't accept limit

tplan is pointing at the wrong point for probpath and dom path (tpl_runs_reg)


Run algs can't be condensed because of the way solution length
recording is handled

Will algorithms with overlapping names (weighted A* is wted_astar with
or without duplicates for example) be a problem in the future?
