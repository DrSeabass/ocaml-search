Readme for the experiments code -
  Really, just a couple of notes on how to keep things organized, how
  to cut down on code repetition and clutter.


Adding Algorithms:
------------------

	There should be an .ml file which matches a directory in
	search for each directory in search.  If there isn't, add it.

	This ML file contains calls to each of the search algorithms
	described in that folder within the search system.
	Alphabetical or chronological order is fine, but we should
	decide on one and go with it.

	If a very common call isn't provided by your code for some
	reason (like you don't have a version which handles
	duplicates) include it according to the naming scheme and have
	it fail with an appropriate message.



Adding Domains:
