* Generate documentation

* Generate 'packages'

* Files being dependent on an Extension
   Currently, a file won't re-build if it uses a parser which is
   updated

* Detect circular dependencies

* BUG: --clean doesn't remove _ocm dirs from subdirectories that are
   only specified on Results files (and not the main Files list).
