----------
* Machines connected by transports with known time to convey material
* Machines have a set number of actions with known durations
* Multiple input sources for raw material
* Multiple outputs for raw material
* (2011-03-14, the following is not true in the implemented version
  where durations are fixed) Actions have an upper and lower bound on
  their durations
* Locations (machines) and resources are not equivalent (a machine can
  work on multiple material at once)
* Each 'job' has an initial location, a goal location, background
  knowledge and a batch number that it is associated with (2011-03-14,
  no batches in implemented version).  The background knowledge seems
  to be predicates about the layouts of the machines or something
  (from the example: CanCutShape(Machine-2, Cylinder-Type-2)).
