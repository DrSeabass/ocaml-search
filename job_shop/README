                         Job shop scheduling

This solver finds all possibly conflicts between pairs of operations
and searches over the space of orderings between pairs.  Uses an STN
to determine if a set of orderings becomes inconsistent.
Additionally, the constraint based analysis of Smith and Cheng
("Slack-Based Heuristics For Constraint Satisfaction Scheduling," AAAI
, 1993) is used to propagate some constraints among the orderings.
Additionally, the heuristic used to order the pairs is the bslack2
heuristic of S&C and the value ordering heuristic is max slack.

There are two implementations of this domain:

1) Job_shop - a very slow implementation where state is copied
everywhere.

2) Jsp - a much faster (and newer and hopefully easier to read)
implementation using in-place modification of a single state.
