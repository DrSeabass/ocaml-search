Ocaml Search Code

# Description

Algorithms and domains produced by the UNH Artificial Intelligence research
group between 2006-2014.  I certainly can't claim sole ownership of the code.
Many researchers contributed to the code base over these years, and their names
are captured in @author tags in various files.

Please direct questions to Jordan Thayer.

# State Of The Code

This is a snapshot of the research code around 2012, when the group switched to
doing much of it's research in C++ for performance reasons.

Everything relies on a custom build tool, ocm2, to build.  You'll need to
bootstrap ocm2 by building ocm first.  Once ocm2 is built, you should be able to
build solvers and instance generators directly.

# Coming Soon

An actual description of the directiories and their contents.
Also some build instructions and documentation.
