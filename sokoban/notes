Real sokoban is substantially different from nethack sokoban (solved
blocks are not gone, generating floors).

The standard extension name for the sokoban files I'm using is xsb

I ignore everything but the board

When outputting a solution (assuming we do that), they use the
characters u,d,l,r,U,D,L,R.  Capitals mean you are pushing a crate
during that move.

Detecting non-solvable states and pruning them is going to be
absolutely key

Everything needs to be set up so that an arbitrary walk / push ration
can be set up.


The nethack boards have more boulders than goal positions, so the goal
test will have to be modified to account for that.
