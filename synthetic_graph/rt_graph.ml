(** Ruml and Thayer Synthetic Graphs
    Notes towards the creation of a synthetic graph:

    1.  Start with an n-ary RST tree.
    2.  At every layer, consider additional edges between nodes at this layer
    3.  Probability of adding edges at a layer and number of edges at a layer
          can be varried independently **)
