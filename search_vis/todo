Path drawing

Controllable timing on the redraws

Proper redrawing during an interruption

need to lower the printout and the scale

scale showing the meanings of the colors displayed somewhere?

Need to be able to report area consumed by an object to other objects
to make drawing a lot less magical

how will I handle queues which don't yet exist (optimized optimistic
  search) Two options?  Either 1) we implement a new search
  specifically for recording purposes or 2) we alter the way structs
  are recorded so that we know what search step they came into
  existence during.  Both suck, but one must happen.

Ask about getting GTK setup so that I can spawn multiple windows
 or can graphics do that for me?  That'd be nice.

Tool around with scaling

Multiqueue overlays are still odd.  Order has a large and undesired
  effect.  Maybe do them up as tuples where the second member is
  order, or n-ples where the other members specify head highlighting
  and draw sequence?

 Highlight for the head of each queue

 Selecting which queues are overlayed on the main image
    default being to overlay all the images
