* The bound_for_wted_combo function is implemented in OCaml and is
   fairly inefficient.  This function could be moved to C and changed
   so that it doesn't allocate and scale a histogram.  Instead it
   could traverse the histograms as expected.

   Make sure this is implemented properly.  It would appear that using
   this function is dangerous because it can return a pruning bound
   that prunes too much weight after a weighted add is performed.

   Maybe it would be beneficial to write a function to accumulate
   weight across a histogram.  This could then be factored out of a
   couple other histogram functions too.

* Move the add function to C.  Currently the add function is
   implemented in OCaml and I think that this makes it a bit slower
   than is needed.  If this function was moved to C then a bunch of
   the function calls would be inlined instead of calling them across
   programming language boundaries.

* points_val_for_weight should interpolate a value on the last point.
   This is what Wheeler's histogram does.
