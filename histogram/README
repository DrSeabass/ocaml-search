                        OCaml histogram module
                        ----------------------

This implements a simple histogram structure.  The majority of the
structure is implemented in C and there are bindings for OCaml.



            What if I update OCaml in the group directory?
            ----------------------------------------------

Well, you probably should rebuild this model and re-install it in the
proper place.  To do this, edit the makefile and change the OCAML_DIR
variable to point to the latest OCaml install directory.  Then

$ make clean all install
