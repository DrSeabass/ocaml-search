----------- experimental db

edb-path root-directory ( KEY=VALUE )*

   returns path to new file (or error if file exists)
   will invalidate any cache files that match key

   do auto-renaming using something like `unspecified'
   use a marker for files to ignore: IGNORE as prefix?
     also ignore CACHE

edb-cache root-directory ( KEY=VALUE )* name

   returns path to file (created if necessary) that corresponds to
   cache for `name' which is a function of all the matches to the keys

   have separate file for each name

   like match, but don't descend into anything more specific

edb-match root-directory ( KEY=VALUE )*

   returns paths (or attribute groups), line by line, flushing as it
     goes (for maximum blocking I/O)
